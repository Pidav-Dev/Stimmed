## Game Design Document

### Game Concepts

**Game idea:** Understand how people with sensory overload feel and live their lives by preventing the protagonist of the game from feeling sensory overloaded in everyday settings

**Inspirations:** 

**Input controls:** 

- Mobile controls:
    
    **Tap:** Select the environment object (or interact if selected)
    
    **Pan:** Move the room
    
    **Hold down and slide:** interact
    
    **Drag and drop:** remove objects
    
    **Pinch to zoom:** zoom into the environment
    
    **Shake:** 
    
    **Gyroscope:** 
        

**Winning condition**: you clear the situation, the protagonist is not sensory overwhelmed anymore

**Losing condition**: you let the protagonist overwhelm

### Game Characters

**Hero:** Average Joe who suffers from sensory overload due to GAD

**Enemies:** Any kind of visual, light and auditory stimuli

### Gameplay

**Game - world Layout:** closed environments possibly filled with sensory stimuli, in possibly anxious situations

**Starting condition:** You’re in an overwhelming situation with your endurance full

**Ending condition:** The room is cleared from harmful stimuli and with your endurance not empty

**Point system:** Endurance (float between 0 to 100 that decreases when sensory stimuli are not deleted) and Time taken

**Heads - Up Display:** Nothing except from pause button

### Difficulty Balance

**Difficulty heat points:** 

- Amount of sensory stimuli 

- Complexity of interactions needed to clear it (Simple - Medium - Hard interactions)

- Time between stimuli spawning

**Implementation plan:**
